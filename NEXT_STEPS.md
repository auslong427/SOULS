7. **âœ… Build Verified** - App successfully builds and compiles

## ðŸŽ¯ What You Need to Do

To complete the Plasmic integration, you need to provide your **Plasmic Project ID**.

### Option 1: Quick Setup (Recommended)

Run the interactive setup script:

```bash
./setup-plasmic.sh
```

This script will:
- Prompt you for your Plasmic Project ID
- Automatically update `plasmic.json` with the correct configuration
- Optionally run `plasmic sync` to pull your designs

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Find Your Project ID:**
   - Go to https://studio.plasmic.app
   - Open your project
   - Look at the browser URL: `https://studio.plasmic.app/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID`
   - Copy the `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` part
   
   OR
   
   - In Plasmic Studio, click the "Code" button in the toolbar
   - Your Project ID will be displayed along with the API token

2. **Update plasmic.json:**
   
   Edit the `plasmic.json` file and replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID_HERE` in the projects array:
   
   ```json
   {
     "projects": [
       {
         "projectId": "YOUR_ACTUAL_PROJECT_ID",
         "version": "latest",
         "cssFilePath": "plasmic/plasmic.module.css",
         "components": [],
         "projectApiToken": "JxZwyCPnLLahkvdzIZMqa7x4ogrcTUdeZ7NId1tW5vc2gxcixZTU3VFObPUi64FuDYTBY9XStBTT1umBEBB8g"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Sync Your Designs:**
   
   ```bash
   plasmic sync
   ```
   
   This will download your Plasmic components to `src/components/plasmic/`

4. **Start Development:**
   
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Sync

To automatically sync changes from Plasmic Studio as you design:

```bash
plasmic watch
```

This will monitor your Plasmic project and sync updates in real-time.

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "Project not found" Error
- Verify your Project ID is correct
- Ensure you have access to the project in Plasmic Studio

### "Authentication failed" Error
- The API token is already configured correctly
- This error typically means the Project ID is wrong or doesn't match the token

### Components Not Syncing
- Make sure components are published in Plasmic Studio
- Check that `plasmic.json` has the correct configuration
- Try running `plasmic sync --force` to force a resync

**Important Security Note:** The API token included in this setup is a public token designed to be safely committed to your repository. It only allows reading published designs and cannot modify your Plasmic project.

Once you complete these steps, your Plasmic designs will be integrated with your SoulSync app! ðŸŽ‰
